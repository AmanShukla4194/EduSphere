# 🎓 EduSphere – Mini Learning Management Portal

EduSphere is a small, interactive LMS-style web project built completely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a learning platform can be simulated on the client side without a backend or database, while still offering smooth navigation, dynamic content, and an engaging quiz experience.

This project was created as a practical demonstration of front-end development, DOM manipulation, and clean UI design. Everything is handled on the browser using static data stored in JavaScript objects and arrays.
